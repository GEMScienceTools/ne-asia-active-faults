		<SimpleData name="notes">Walker found evidence for 1-2 earthquakes over the last 16 ka, with 8 m of vertical displacement, yielding ~1 mm/yr dip slip. However, there is only 225 m of total offset on a 6 Ma basalt, yielding a late Neogene rate of 0.04 mm/yr. The faster rate is preferred as it more accurately describes the current slip regime.</SimpleData>
